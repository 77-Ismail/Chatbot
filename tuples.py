# Tuples are immutable means once it is defined we cant change the values of tuple by index variable

#Types or we can say classification of tuples
# 1.Two tuple ('a','b') Means two variables or elements in tuples
# 2.Three tuple ('a','b','c') Means three variables or elements in tuples

#Sort, Append, and Reverse all these will back to traceback Eerror Because these are not possible in python

#Tuple have two functions like count and index check in example

# #Comparison is also possible in tuple like we can compare two tuples
